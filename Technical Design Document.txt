Program Description:
This program is designed to pre-sell cinema tickets. There are 20 tickets available, and each buyer can purchase up to 4
tickets. The program frequently prompts users to input how many tickets they want to buy, checks if the input is valid,
and continues this process until all tickets are sold. Finally after the sale is complete, the program displays the total
number of buyers.

Logical Steps:
1. Initialize the total number of available tickets (MAX_TICKETS) and the maximum number of tickets a single buyer can
purchase (MAX_TICKETS_PER_BUYER).
2. Set up variables to keep track of the remaining tickets (remaining_tickets) and the total number of buyers (total_buyers).
3. Enter a loop that continues until there are no remaining tickets.
4. Display the current number of remaining tickets.
5. Prompt the user to enter the number of tickets they wish to buy.
6. Check if the input is a valid number.
7. If the input is valid, convert it to an integer and check if it falls within the allowed range (between 1 and the
minimum of MAX_TICKETS_PER_BUYER and remaining_tickets).
8. If the input is within the allowed range, subtract the requested number of tickets from remaining_tickets and
increment total_buyers by 1.
9. If the input is not valid or not within the allowed range, display an error message and prompt the user to enter a
valid number.
10. After all tickets are sold, exit the loop and display the total number of buyers.
