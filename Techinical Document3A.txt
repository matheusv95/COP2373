Program Description:
This program collects monthly expenses from user, including the type of expense and the amount, and then calculates and
displays the total expense, and also identifies the highest and lowest expense according to their response.

Logical Steps:
1. Input collection:
Continuously ask the user to enter the type and amount of each expense until the user types "done".
Store each expense as a tuple in a list called expenses.
2. Calculations:
Total expense: Use the reduce function with an add_expenses function to sum all the expenses amounts.
Highest expense: Use the reduce function with a find_max function to determine the expense with the highest amount.
Lowest expense: Use the reduce function with a find_min function to determine the expense with the lowest amount.
3. Output:
Print the total expense.
Print the highest expense, including its type and amount.
Print the lowest expense, including its type and amount.

Variables:
Expenses: List of tuples, where each contains the type of expense and its amount.
total_expense: Float, representing the total of all expense amounts.
highest_expense: Tuple, containing the type and amount of the highest expense.
lowest_expense: Tuple, containing the type and amount of the lowest expense.

Functions:
Function name: add_expenses(acc, expense):
Description: Accumulates the total expense by adding the amount of each expense to the accumulator.
Function name: find_max(expense1, expense2):
Description: Compares two expenses and returns the one with the greater amount.
Function name: find_min(expense1, expense2):
Description: Compares two expenses and returns the one with the less amount.
