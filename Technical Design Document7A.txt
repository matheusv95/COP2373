    Program Description:
This program allows the user to input any number of sentences, including sentences that begins with a number. When typed "Done",
the program will stop and display all sentences, and also shows the total number of sentences entered.

Sentences: Create an empty list called sentences to store all entered sentences.
Asks for input: Use a loop to continuously ask user to enter a sentence.
Check for termination: after each input, check if the input matches "Done", if it does, exit the loop/
Store sentences: If the input is not "Done", add the sentences to the 'sentence' list.
Display results: After exit the loop, display each sentence on a new line, followed by the total number of sentences entered.
    Variables:
Sentences: Stores all sentences entered by the user.
    Functions:
main(): Manages the sentences input process, checks for the termination condition, stores sentences, and displays the final.
