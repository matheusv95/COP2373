Program Description: This python program simulates population growth for 10 cities in Florida over 20 years. The user can also
view the population trends for a city using a line graph.
Logical Steps:
Database Creation- Create a SQlite database named population_MH.db
Define a table named population with city, year, and population.
Initial Data Insertion- Populate the table with 2023 data for the 10 cities in Florida.
Simulate Population Growth- Calculate population Growth at a rate of 2% per year for the next 20 years.
Insert the calculated data into the database.
User Interaction and Visualization- Present the list of cities to the user.
Allows the user to select a city and display its popular growth as a graph.
Repeat until user exit.
Variables:
db_name - Stores the name of the SQLite database file.
initial_data - Holds the 2023 population data of cities.
city - Stores the selected city name
population - Tracks population values for calculations.
years - Stores years for graph plotting.
Functions:
create_database(): creates the SQLite database and table.
insert_initial_data(): Inserts the initial data for 10 cities.
simulate_population_growth(): Simulates population growth over 20 years.
display_population_growth(): Allows user interaction and display graphs.
