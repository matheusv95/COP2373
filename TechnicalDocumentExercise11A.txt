Program Description:
This program simulates a simple Poker hand game. This program deals an initial hand of five cards for the user. The user is then asked
to select which cards to place by entering the position of the cards. Then selected cards are replaced with the new ones
from the deck, and finally the final hand is displayed.
Logical steps:
1. Create Card and Deck classes to represent the cards and deck.
2. Define methods for shuffling the deck and specified number of cards.
3. Implement a function display_hand() to show the user's current hand.
4. Write the main() function:
Variables:
Suit- Represents the suit of a card
Rank- Represents the rank of a card
Cards- a list of card objects representing the full deck
hand- A list of card objects representing the player's current hand
replace_input- a string capturing user input for card positions to replace
positions- a list of integers indicating the indices of cards to be replaced
Functions:
__init__() - Initializing card and deck object
__str__(): Method in the card class that returns a string representation of the card
shuffle(): Method in the deck class that shuffles the deck
deal(num): Deals num cards from the top of the deck
display_hand(hand): Function that prints each card in the player's hand with position numbers.
